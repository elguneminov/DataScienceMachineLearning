# DataScienceMachineLearning
This is a complete Data Science and Machine Learning Course: https://www.youtube.com/diggingdata

The course contains:

Python Crash Course
Python Library - Numpy
Python Library - Pandas
Python Library - Matplotlib
Python Library - Seaborn
Plotly

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
K Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
K Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis
Natural Language Processing
Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The best thing about the course is that the course starts with building basic Python Programming skills and then it explore necessary Python Libraries and then it moves to Machine Learning Algorithm. 95% tutorials are code-based which means you will be writing code and implementing Machine Learning Models. Doesn't sound interesting? We have got more for you. You get Jupyter Notebook of every video. Not only this, you get a project exercise for practice because we believe practice doubles the learning.
